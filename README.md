# SwiftQueueServer (QS)

SwiftQueueServer (QS) is designed for extreme player counts by cutting down on unnecessary functionality. It serves as a perfect buffer between your network and players during peak influx times, preventing strain on your server.

Just like large servers such as Hypixel, this approach helps maintain stability when many players are trying to join.

This idea was originally suggested by Sprock / Cobble Sword, who didn’t finish it. We’re taking the lead to make it happen and improve it even further!
